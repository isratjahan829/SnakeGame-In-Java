# SnakeGame-In-Java

# The SnakeGame class represents the main game logic and GUI for the Snake Game.

It implements a simple Snake Game using Java Swing. The game features a snake that moves around a game board and tries to eat apples to increase its score. The player controls the snake's movement using arrow keys.The game board is displayed in a window, and the snake, apple, and score are rendered using graphics. The game includes collision detection to handle cases where the snake collides with itself or reaches the edges of the board, resulting in game over.It also includes a basic implementation of a score display and a game over message. The game parameters such as the size of the board, snake, and apple, as well as the speed of the game, can be adjusted.This code offers a foundation for further extension and customization, allowing for the addition of new features and mechanics to enhance the gameplay.
